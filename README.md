# Contentstack App SDK

The **JSON Rich Text Editor Plugins** lets you add/create custom plugins to extend the functionality of your [JSON Rich Text Editor](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/json-rich-text-editor/about-json-rich-text-editor/) as per your needs. You can use the prebuilt JSON RTE plugins by modifying the code to suit your requirement.

Some of the examples of the prebuilt JSON Rich Text Editor plugins are:

-   Highlight: Allows you to highlight certain parts of your content, such as a whole line of text or a paragraph.

-   Info Panel: Allows you to place important content inside a colored panel to make it stand out.

-   Word Count: Allows you to track the word count for your JSON Rich Text Editor content.

You can create JSON Rich Text Editor Plugins using the Contentstack App SDK. For more information, read our [documentation](https://www.contentstack.com/docs/developers/json-rich-text-editor-plugins/about-json-rte-plugins/).
